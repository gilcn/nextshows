BEFORE RELEASING v2.0.0:
- Fix some GUI bugs when using Qt4.3.0....
  (Finally this will be planned for later releases)
- Fix "special episodes" display in the widget


LATER (MAYBE :p):
- Whether a cache refresh/update occurs, check whether the show is terminated
  or not and update the GUI accordingly
- Allow the user to select a color per show rather than having a color showing
  the remaining days
- Allow the user to chose how the widget should be expanded (top or bottom) in
  case automatic resize is selected
