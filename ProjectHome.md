## NOTE TO KDE 4 USERS ##
Although KDE 4 can execute KDE 3 SuperKaramba widgets, nextShows is really borked (at least with KDE 4.1.x). For some unknown reasons many things aren't working as expected. I plan to ~~port nextShows to Plasma~~ _(**Edit:** finally it won't be a plasmoid thanks to the poor documentation/tutorials on KDE websites)_ but I can't give any date therefore it'll be out "when it's ready"Â©.


## Description ##
A desktop widget (aka applet) for [SuperKaramba](http://netdragon.sourceforge.net/ssuperkaramba.html) that displays the coming air dates for your favorite TV shows.


## Requirements ##
Current stable release requires:
  * [KDE](http://www.kde.org/) v3.5.x (if you use an older KDE release, make sure SuperKaramba is up to date)
  * [Python](http://www.python.org/) v2.5 or later (previous versions **WON'T** work)
  * [Qt](http://trolltech.com/products/qt) v4.3.1 or later
  * [PyQt](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/) v4.3.1 or later
