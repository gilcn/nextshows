=ChangeLog=

*v2.0.4:*
  * Fix the forgetfulness I committed in the previous (2.0.3) release.

*v2.0.3:*
  * This release should fix the crash reported in the comments that affected Debian/Ubuntu (and probably other distros).

*v2.0.2:*
  * Due to changes on tvrage.com, the "Filter" feature and years in the search results were removed :(.
  * Parser fixed to reflect those changes.

*v2.0.1:*
  *Parser update/fix.

*v2.0.0:*
Code (almost) fully rewritten. Main changes are:
  * Dropped www.tv.com and now using www.tvrage.com to fetch necessary shows/episodes informations.
  * A configuration GUI (no need to edit the configuration file by hand anymore!!!).
  * User can now customize his colors while displaying episodes (this part of the configuration dialog needs some love to be more usable but it is working).
  * Added preliminary work for supporting other themes/skins but disabled in this release since there's only 1 theme available (contributors welcome :).
  * Other minor things I can't remember.


*v1.0.0:*
  * First public release !
