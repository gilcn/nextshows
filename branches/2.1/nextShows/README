HOW TO USE NEXTSHOWS ?

If you want to test the following code you can do:
$ ./toolbox gui
This will compile forms and resources necessary for the configuration GUI to
work.

$ superkaramba nextShows.theme
Hopefully this will launch nextShows (subject that nothing is broken in the SVN
at that time)

You can also create a SuperKaramba theme file and test it:
$ ./toolbox skz
This will create a file ../nextShows-x.y.z.skz

$ superkaramba ../nextShows-x.y.z.skz
Hopefully this will launch nextShows (subject that nothing is broken in the SVN
at that time)
