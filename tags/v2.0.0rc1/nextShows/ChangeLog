* --- --- -- 2007 (1.99.5) - Non Public
- Added a bunch of new flags in config GUI's resource files (thanks to
  "dlflags.py" script)
- Project hosted on Google Code... No detailed ChangeLog necessary anymore since
  we use Google's SVN server. This Changelog will be wiped in the future and
  will just reflect major differences between stable releases.

* Fri May 25 2007 (1.99.4) - Non Public
- libs/Applet (almost) complete
- color support, displays episode list, etc....
- launchGUI: Added a warning (kdialog based) when PyQt4 isn't installed
- added [misc], "date_format" to configuration (only editable by hand for now)
- Adjusted values in themes/Original/theme.info
- More work on nextShows.py (need a huge code cleanup)
- Some improvements were made in cgui/NextShowsConfig.py
- Again lots of fixes, etc...

* Thu May 24 2007 (1.99.3) - Non Public
- libs/Cache.py: Added a function to purge cache dir
- All the main core features should be ready (except if some uncatched nasty
  bugs are left in the code :)
- tvrage.com markup change in search results. Fixed libs/TvRage.py
- added /themes dir (in case we want to add more skins later)
  for now only 1 theme is available... this should be invisible to the user
  and the necessary code won't be added in the GUI unless another theme is
  available.
- Started work on libs/Applet -> init() and theme import
- Moved Globals().__init__.DEBUG -> Globals.DEBUG (much faster)
- Enable/Disable DEBUG from config file as soon as we read it !
