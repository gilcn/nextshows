GUI:
- Add a date_format entry in the GUI so that the user can choose how he wants
  to display date
- Enable support for theme and fix some remaining parts of the theming engine


MAIN:
- Whether a cache refresh/update occurs, check whether the show is terminated
  or not and update the GUI accordingly
- Allow the user to select a color per show rather than having a color showing
  the remaining days
- Allow the user to chose how the widget should be expanded (top or bottom) in
  case automatic resize is selected
